        To Nenad Manoilov: Finally got things to where I want them. I am sorry this is a day late,
    but I would rather send in a completed assignment than an incomplete. Hopefully, I shall be able to 
    participate in this weeks zoom class, since the internet should be fixed. Please let me know how I
    can improve. Thanks! -->

                    <p> Welcome to our cafe, where stories are told and memories are made.
                    Our cooks are trained by our Head Chef, John Smith, who graduated from ABC Culinary School.
                    With their love and skills, you are sure to enjoy all our seasonal dishes that we update and change 
                    every week. We offer seasonal ingredients from local farmers and vendors for the freshest produce.
