        To Nenad Manoilov: Hi! I am still rather new to HTML. I hope this is similar to the code
        structure you used. I did change a couple of things, just for aesthetic reasons. Please 
        let me know what I could improve on. Thanks! - Grace -->

                <p> Welcome to our cafe, where stories are told and memories are made.
                Our cooks are trained by our Head Chef, John Smith, who graduated from ABC Culinary School.
                With their love and skills, you are sure to enjoy all our seasonal dishes that we update and change 
                every week. We offer seasonal ingredients from local farmers and vendors for the freshest produce. 
                We hope that you will visit us to experience great food and a fantastic atmosphere.
